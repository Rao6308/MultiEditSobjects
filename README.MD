Multi Edit component with option to edit multiple records of an sobject. 

Future scope of this project is to implmenent Lightning data service instead of quering the data. Current code queries the Id/Name, aiming at building a clean interface that can query all the fields related to an sobject and present it to the user to select fields per object.
